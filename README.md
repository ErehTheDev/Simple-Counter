# Counter App 🧮

A simple and interactive **Counter App** to keep track of numbers with ease.  
Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## 📚 About This Project

This project was built entirely by myself with no external tutorials or help. The goal was to create a simple, intuitive counter app using core web development skills: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

I worked independently on this project, designing and implementing the features from scratch. It was a great way to improve my understanding of JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

## ✨ Custom Features Added

- **Customizable buttons** to increment and decrement the counter.
- **Reset button** to quickly return the counter to zero.

These features were added to make the app more engaging and functional.

## 🕹️ Features

- Simple counter that can be increased, decreased, or reset.
- Clear visual feedback to show the current count.
- **Responsive design** for mobile and desktop use.
